# Rethinking Visual Geo-localization for Large-Scale Applications
This is the official repository for the CVPR 2022 paper "Rethinking Visual Geo-localization for Large-Scale Applications".
The paper presents a new dataset called San Francisco eXtra Large (SF-XL, go [_here_](https://forms.gle/wpyDzhDyoWLQygAT9) to download it), and a highly scalable training method (called CosPlace), which allows to reach SOTA results with compact descriptors.
To reproduce our results you simply need a 8GB GPU for a day (but beware that the SF-XL dataset is ~750GB heavy).

## Code
Code is coming soon (before mid-April).
